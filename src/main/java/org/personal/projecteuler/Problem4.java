   /**
    * Iterates through numbers of a given digit length that are multiples of 11, from largest to smallest to find the largest palindrome formed by the product of two of these numbers
    * 
    * @reasoning - First, we're looking for the largest palindrome, which will be produced by the product of larger numbers, so we sort from larger to smaller. 
    *       Second, all palindromes are divisible by 11. 
    *       Proof: Take a palindrome formed by the product of two three-digit numbers (note that the length of the palindrome doesn't matter).
    *       It can be expressed in the form 100000x+10000y+1000z+100z+10y+x, with x, y, and z being single digits which don't have to be distinct
    *       This can be simplified to 100001x+10010y+1100z, or 11(9091x+910y+100z), so it will always be divisible by 11, regardless of the values of x, y, and z.
    *       Therefore, at least one of the two values multiplied to give a palindrome must be divisible by 11. If one is not, we know that the other must be.
    * @evidence - 9009 / 11 = 819, and one of its two double-digit factors, 99, is also divisible by 11. (99/11 = 9)
