# Project-Euler
My work for problems posted at the Project Euler website, to be added to daily if all goes well, or weekly should school decide to intensify my workload. 
I try to create solutions that can work for any inputed value for a problem (within reason), rather than the value given in the problem. This sometimes reduces the possibility of easy solutions (i.e. the given value is divisible by 3 but not all possible values will be), but I think it's a challenge that forces me to write more robust code.
